## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)

---

### 📦 Install Requirements

Install all required dependencies using pip:


pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
▶️ Run the Application



-Start the Flask server by running:

**py app.py**

Then, open your browser and navigate to:

👉 http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict

---

🔁 How It Works
User fills out a form with:

💠Name

💠Age

💠Role

💠Years of Experience




-The form data is sent to the backend via Flask.



-A pre-trained machine learning model (model.pkl) processes the input and predicts the salary.



-The predicted salary is shown below the form in green with a ₹ symbol.

---



🔄 Change the Port (Optional)
-If you want to run the app on a different port, modify the last line of app.py:

**app.run(debug=True, port=8080)**



-Replace 8080 with any available port of your choice (e.g., 5000, 3000, etc.).

---

🧪 Train the Model (Optional)
-To train or update the model with new data:

**py trainmodel.py**



▪Ensure that salary.csv is formatted like this:

-Name,Age,Role,Experience,Salary



-John,30,Developer,5,50000


-Alice,28,Designer,3,40000


-Bob,35,Manager,8,70000


After running the training script, a new model.pkl file will be generated.
